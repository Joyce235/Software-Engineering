/**
 * <p>Data structure who keeps track of a distinguished position
 * in the sequence that we will call the "cursor position".</p>
 *
 * <p><ul>A traversable list can be depicted
 * using two side-by-side sequences
 * <li>a left sequence and a right sequence.</li></ul>
 * The position between the left sequence
 * and the right sequence is the cursor position.</p>
 *
 * <p>In this stack-based implementation, the leftmost element
 * represents the element at the bottom of the stack
 * , and the rightmost element represents
 * the element at the top of the stack.</p>
 *
 * <p>A typical representation of TravList is
 * <code>[l1, l2, l3, ...][r1, r2, r3, ...]:c</code>
 * where all <code>l</code> elements are in left of cursor
 * and all <code>r</code> elements are in right of cursor.
 * <code>c</code> is the capacity</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementation of this interface should
 * have a one-argument constructor
 * that takes the desired capacity and create an empty TravList.
 * The capacity must be strictly greater than zero.</p>
